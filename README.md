# Project Title

<h2>Music Player</h2>

# What I learned

<p>The goal is to learn essential string and array methods like the find(), forEach(), map(), and join(). These methods are crucial for developing dynamic web applications.</p>

<p> In this project, I code a basic MP3 player using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project covers fundamental concepts such as handling audio playback, managing a playlist, implementing play, pause, next, previous, and shuffle functionalities. I learned how to dynamically update your user interface based on the current song.</p>
